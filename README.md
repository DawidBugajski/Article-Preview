# Article-Previev

Program done entirely by me, idea taken from www.frontendmentor.io

# How it works?

this is a simple component to use on the site, the project shows someone's project, where when you click on social media, a whole bar slides out that shows links to selected social media

# What have I learned in this project?

in the case of this project, I learned how to construct an interactive element that works well with RWD and also practiced the BEM methodology and the use of SASS

# What made me most of the problems?

The biggest problem and task was to ostylate the interactive element for both desktops and cell phones
